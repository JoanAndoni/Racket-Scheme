        [(2) (condDay date (condLeap (caddr date)) 0)]      ; IF IT'S FEBRUARY WE SEND THE YEAR TO CHECK IS IT'S A LEAP AND IT RETURNS THE NUMBER OF DAYS OF THIS MONTH EITHER IS 28 OR 29 THEN WE SEND IT LIKE THE OTHER DATES
        [(4 6 9 11) (condDay date 30 0)]                    ; IF IT'S ONE OF THIS MONTHS RETURN 30 DAYS THAT THE MONTH HAVE AND THE BOOLEAN THAT IS NOT THE LAST MONTH OF THE YEAR
